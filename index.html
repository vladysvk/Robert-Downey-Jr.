    <p>Robert Downey Jr. is one of Hollywood&#39;s most iconic actors, known for his versatility, charisma, and a
        remarkable
        comeback story. Born on April 4, 1965, in New York City, Downey was introduced to acting at a young age by his
        father, Robert Downey Sr., an avant-garde filmmaker. He appeared in his first film at age five, and throughout
        the
        1980s, he built a reputation as a promising young actor, starring in films like Less Than Zero and Chaplin,
        where
        his portrayal of Charlie Chaplin earned him an Academy Award nomination.</p>
    <p>Despite his talent, Downey&#39;s career was marred by struggles with substance abuse, which led to legal issues
        and
        time spent in rehab. His career almost came to a halt in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, in a
        remarkable
        comeback, he rebuilt his career and earned widespread acclaim.</p>
    <p>In 2008, he took on the role of Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a
        character that would become a defining part of his career. Downey&#39;s portrayal of Stark brought wit, humor,
        and
        depth to the character, helping to launch a billion-dollar franchise and cementing his place in Hollywood
        history.
        Beyond Iron Man, he’s known for Sherlock Holmes, which showcased his skill in a different genre.</p>
    <p>Off-screen, Downey has used his platform to advocate for causes like addiction recovery and environmental
        sustainability. His journey from troubled star to one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a testament to
        resilience and the power of reinvention. His story continues to inspire fans around the world.</p>
